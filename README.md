# Models From Scratch

Repository to program different Machine Learning models from scratch to gain a deeper undertsanding of their implementation

## General Model Backlog

### PreProcessing
- One-Hot Encoding
- Implement logging

### Plotting
Plotting functionality handled similar to the .functions/ package
- Decision tree
- ROC Curve - Trade-off between True Positive Rate & False Positive Rate used for comparing models
- Precision-Recall Curve - Trade-off between Precision & Recall used for class imbalance problems
- How F1 Score changes across thresholds, used for tuning thresholds

## Logistic Model Implementation
- Basic Implementation

## Neural Network Model Implementation
- Basic Implementation

## Random Forest Implementation
- Implementation using DecisionTreeModel variations

## Decision Tree Backlog
- Best split categorical
- Combine numerical and categorical splits
- Testing with different cost functions
- Plotting
