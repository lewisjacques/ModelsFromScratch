# Models From Scratch

    Repository to program different Machine Learning models from scratch to gain a deeper undertsanding of their implementation

## General Model Backlog
- Build in preprocessing functionality
    - One-Hot Encoding
    - Implement logging

## Decision Tree Backlog
- Plotting

## Random Forest
- Implementation using DecisionTreeModel variations

## Neural Network implementation
- Basic Implementation

## Plotting
Plotting functionality similar to the .function/ package
- Decision tree
- ROC Curve - Trade-off between True Positive Rate & False Positive Rate used for comparing models
- Precision-Recall Curve - Trade-off between Precision & Recall used for class imbalance problems
- How F1 Score changes across thresholds, used for tuning thresholds
